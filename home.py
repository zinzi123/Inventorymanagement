# Section 1: Deterministic (Constant) Demand Inventory Management
st.markdown('<div class="section-content"><div class="section-title"><span class="icon">ðŸ“¦</span>1. Deterministic (Constant) Demand Inventory Management</div>', unsafe_allow_html=True)
st.write("""
Ideal for stable and predictable demand environments. Key points include:
- **EOQ**: Optimal order quantity to minimize costs.
- **Replenishment Period**: Regular time interval between orders.
- **Inventory Simulation**: Simulation of inventory turnover over time with relevant visuals.
- **Cost Analysis**: Visualization of relevant cost heads monthly and yearly.
- **Cumulative COGS & Turnover**: Visuals showing the cumulative impact.

# Section 2: Probabilistic Inventory Management with Continuous Review Policy
st.markdown('<div class="section-content"><div class="section-title"><span class="icon">ðŸ”„</span>2. Probabilistic Inventory Management with Continuous Review Policy</div>', unsafe_allow_html=True)

st.write("""
This model is designed for environments with fluctuating demand and requires continuous monitoring of inventory levels. Key aspects include:

- **Economic Order Quantity (EOQ)**: Determines the optimal order quantity to minimize the sum of ordering and holding costs. 
- **Reorder Point**: The inventory level at which a new order is placed to avoid stockouts, calculated considering safety stock.
- **Safety Stock**: Additional inventory held to mitigate the risk of stockouts due to demand variability or supply delays.
- **Inventory Simulation**: Simulates inventory levels over time, taking into account demand variability, reorder points, and lead times. 
- **Cost Analysis**: Provides insights into the total cost of inventory management, including ordering costs, holding costs, and the cost of stockouts.

# Section 3: Probabilistic Inventory Management with Periodic Review Policy
st.markdown('<div class="section-content"><div class="section-title"><span class="icon">ðŸ“…</span>3. Probabilistic Inventory Management with Periodic Review Policy</div>', unsafe_allow_html=True)
st.write("""
In this model, we implement a **Periodic Review Policy** to improve inventory management, especially when dealing with a large portfolio of items with varying replenishment cycles. This approach is more efficient compared to continuous review policies for diverse inventories.

Key features include:

- **Handling Multiple SKUs**: Manages inventory for various products, each with its own demand patterns and review intervals.
- **Order-Up-To Level**: Sets the target inventory level to which stock should be replenished at each review, optimizing stock levels.
- **Reorder Point**: Establishes the inventory level at which new orders are triggered to prevent stockouts, factoring in lead time and safety stock.
- **Actual Performance Measurement**: Compares simulated performance with actual metrics to assess how well the policy maintains inventory levels and avoids stockouts.
